## Overview

As a computer science major, it is likely that I will learn about different programming languages and how to use them to create software. The "Hello World" program is a common first step in learning a new programming language, as it is a simple program that displays the message "Hello World" on the screen. By creating this program, I  learn the basic syntax and structure of the C# programming language and how to use it to create a simple software application.

The purpose of creating this software is to familiarize myself with the process of creating a program using C# and to practice using various technologies, such as Git, GitHub, Visual Studio, and the .Net framework. These technologies are widely used in the software development industry and learning how to use them is an important part of my computer science degree. By creating this simple "Hello World" program, I am gaining valuable experience and skills that will help me in my future career as a software developer.

## Development Environment

To develop the software, I used a variety of tools, including a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio. I also used version control software like Git and a hosting platform like GitHub to manage my code and collaborate with others.

The programming language used to develop the software was C#, a modern, object-oriented language that is widely used for creating a variety of software applications, including desktop applications, mobile apps, and web applications. C# is known for its simplicity, power, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for many developers.
